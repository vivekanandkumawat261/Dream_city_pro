ðŸ”‘ Step-by-Step Plan Based on Your Skills
âœ… Step 1: Polish What You Already Know
Before learning new stuff, make sure youâ€™re solid with:

âœ… HTML: semantic tags, accessibility, forms

âœ… CSS: Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsiveness (media queries)

âœ… JavaScript: ES6+, DOM manipulation, fetch API, promises/async-await

âœ… Express.js: routes, middlewares, error handling, REST APIs

âœ… Mongoose: schema design, queries, validations

ðŸ§  Build smaller parts of this big app using your current stack to practice â€” e.g., user login system, data display from MongoDB, etc.

ðŸ†™ Step 2: Learn the Missing Skills Youâ€™ll Need
To build Ville de rÃªve Pro as described, youâ€™ll want to learn:

ðŸš€ Frontend (new skills to learn)

Skill	Why You Need It	How Long It Takes to Learn (basics)
Vue.js (Composition API)	For building the dynamic UI with components	3â€“5 days
Vite	Fast dev setup for Vue	1 day
Tailwind CSS	Easy and modern way to style	2â€“3 days
Pinia	State management in Vue (like Redux)	1â€“2 days
Axios	For API calls	You already know fetch â€“ Axios is easy (~1 day)
ECharts	To render charts	2â€“3 days (start with examples)
Leaflet	For interactive maps	2â€“3 days with docs/examples
WebDataRocks	For pivot tables	Just plug it in and theme it â€” minimal logic
Vue Router	For page routing/navigation	1 day
You donâ€™t need to master all of these before starting â€” just pick up what you need as you go.

ðŸ”§ Backend (you already have it!)
Youâ€™re good here, but the original project uses an external REST API. For your version:

Youâ€™ll build your own backend using:

Express.js as your API server

MongoDB/Mongoose for the database

Routes to handle city data, user login, tokens, etc.

Optional but helpful:

JWT for access token handling

Stripe integration (if you want to do payments too)
